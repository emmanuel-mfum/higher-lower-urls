# higher-lower-urls
Small higher/lower game written in Python with Flask

The way the game work is that the user must first run the Flask app, a random number between 0  and 9 will be generated by the program . 
Then when the app is running, the user must guess a number and add it to the URL path. 
Depending on the number, the HTML page will display words saying that the number guessed (and typed in the URL) is to high or low. 
If the number guessed by the user is the correct one, the HTML page will indicate so.

Of course appropriate kitten GIFs accompany the rendering of the HTML page.
